# 0x08-making_change

## Description

This project focuses on solving the problem of finding the fewest number of coins needed to meet a given amount total. The solution implements a greedy algorithm approach to minimize the number of coins used. The project is part of the ALX Interview preparation tasks.

## Requirements

- Python 3.4.3
- PEP 8 style guide (version 1.7.x)
- The script is executable (`chmod +x`)

## Files

- **0-making_change.py**: Contains the `makeChange` function, which determines the fewest number of coins needed to meet a given total.
- **0-main.py**: Main file for testing the `makeChange` function.

## Usage

To run the test file:

```bash
$ ./0-main.py
