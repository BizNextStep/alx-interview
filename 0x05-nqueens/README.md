# 0x05. N Queens

## Project Overview

The N Queens problem is a classic computer science problem involving backtracking. The goal is to place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This project involves writing a Python program that solves the N Queens problem for any integer N greater than or equal to 4.
